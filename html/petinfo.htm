						<h1>Worming</h1>

		  <p>
		  Dogs and cats can carry a large amount of roundworms and tapeworms.  These are intestinal parasites which if left untreated can cause illness in your pet.  Approx 90% of puppies and 80% of kittens are born with worms so it is very important that new puppies and kittens should be worm dosed every fortnight until they are 12 weeks old, then dosed monthly until six months of age.  After that the average dog or cat should be worm dosed every three months i.e. four times annually.
          </p>
		  <p>
		  The most common roundworm, "Toxacara", is a human health risk and can result in eye sight problems for children if a child ingests any eggs or larvae. It is therefore essential to worm dose your pet as recommended by your vet and always practice strict hygiene when handling pets. Not all worming products are similar and the amount of dose given depends solely on weight - so if you are unsure of your pet’s weight or which worm dose to give your pet we will be happy to weigh your pet and give you advice on the appropriate worm dose free of charge!
		  </p>
          <p>
		  If you have any questions regarding worming or the effects of worms on your pet you can email us at info@westgatevets.com or fill in the Enquiry Form. You can also check for new information posted on Our Newsletter page. For further information on worming visit www.wormfree.co.uk.

						<h1>Vaccinations</h1>
					</div>

          <p>When a new pet joins the family one of the first concerns should be if the animal has been vaccinated?</p>
		  </section>
		  				<section class="contentAreaWhite">
          <h2>Dogs</h2>
          <p>The main diseases that are covered by vaccinations are:-</p>
          <p><strong>Canine Parvovirus: </strong>This is the most commonly contracted virus amongst dogs. It causes severe vomiting and dysentery (bloody diarrhoea). Usually fatal unless treated intensively (hospitalisation, intravenous drips etc.) which is expensive.
		  </p>
		  <p><strong>Canine Distemper: </strong>Is less common in this country nowadays thanks to the success of vaccination but if contracted is often fatal.</p>
		  <p><strong>Canine Hepatitis: </strong>This virus attacks the liver and can cause sudden fatality in acute cases, and if treated can be a very long road to recovery.</p>
		  <p><strong>Leptospirosis: </strong>This bacterial infection can cause liver and kidney failure, jaundice, acute illness and death.  If presented early it is treatable, but again it can be quite a long road to recovery. It is also a major zoonosis (can be transmitted to humans). It is usually contracted from rats urine.</p>
		  <p><strong>Canine Parainfluenza: </strong>This virus is rarely fatal, however it can cause a very distressing, harsh cough that can continue for many weeks. The disease is commonly known as 'Kennel Cough'.  Most kennels will insist on this vaccine being given before they will admit the animal as it is highly contagious.  The viral part of Kennel Cough is covered by injection but the bacterial part of the disease is a separate vaccine which is given Intra Nasally.</p>
		  <h2>Cats</h2>
		  <p>The main viruses covered by vaccinations are:-</p>
		  <p><strong>Panleucopenia: </strong>This is also known as Feline Enteritis. This virus can cause 'rapid onset', vomiting, bloody diarrhoea and listlessness.  It is very difficult to treat and usually fatal in young cats.</p>
		  <p><strong>Feline Rhinotracheitis/Feline Calicivirus: </strong>Known commonly as Cat Flu these viruses attack the upper Respiratory System causing flu-like symptoms which if left untreated can become very severe.</p>
		  <p><strong>Feline Leukaemia: </strong>This virus is the most serious as it attacks the immune system. This can lead to various cancers and other serious illnesses which will cause death.</p>
		  <p>We must remember that we cannot treat a virus, just the symptoms, so the old cliché 'prevention is better than cure' rings true.</p>
		  <p>If you have any queries on vaccinations for your pet please do not hesitate to contact our nurses directly by telephone, email us at <a href="mailto:info@westgatevets.com">info@westgatevets.com</a> or fill in the Enquiry Form.</p>
